                <p>Jakie W. Rice is the name, Jay-kee Double U Rice is the correct pronunciation. I have lived for an adventure
                    filled twenty-five years. I share my time on this planet with a beautiful wife, an incredibly brilliant
                    seven year old son, an English Mastiff (Hank), a Pitbull-Boxer (Waylon), and Pug (Cash). I have been
                    told that I am the most intensely serious full-grown goofy child in history.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>After six years of dedicated service in the U.S. Army, I started a company with a fellow soldier. Growing
                    as an entrepreneur has proven to be another phenomenal life adventure.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>I have been developing full-stack web applications since the summer of 2016. I am completely self-taught,
                    but I have learned a great deal through trial by fire. My company specializes in business technology
                    and management services for small and medium sized businesses, and there have been occasions where a
                    bespoke software solution was the best option for a client. I have dedicated many hours to learning how
                    to build lean, user-friendly, web applications for on those occasions.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Feel free to contact me through LinkedIn or Github if you'd like to discuss business, web development, or
                    dogs.
