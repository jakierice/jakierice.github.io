Jakie W. Rice is the name, Jay-kee Double U Rice is the correct pronunciation. I have lived for an adventure filled twenty-five years. I share my time on this planet with a beautiful wife, an incredibly brilliant seven year old son, an English Mastiff (Hank), a Pitbull-Boxer (Waylon), and Pug (Cash). I have been told that I am the most intensely serious full-grown goofy child in history.
 
After six years of dedicated service in the U.S. Army, I started a company with a fellow soldier. Growing as an entrepreneur has proven to be another phenomenal life adventure.
 
I have been developing full-stack web applications since the summer of 2016. I am completely self-taught, but I have learned a great deal through trial by fire. My company specializes in business technology and management services for small and medium sized businesses, and there have been occasions where a bespoke software solution was the best option for a client. I have dedicated many hours to learning how to build lean, user-friendly, web applications for on those occasions.
